## Getting Started

To use this converter, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You'll see an input field where you can enter the temperature in Fahrenheit. As you type or change the value, the equivalent temperature in Celsius will be calculated and displayed.

## How It Works

The conversion logic is implemented using JavaScript. The `temperatureConverter` function takes a Fahrenheit value as input, converts it to Celsius, and updates the result in the HTML. The conversion formula used is: `(Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit in the input field.
4. As you type or change the value, the corresponding Celsius value will be shown below.
